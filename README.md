### 摘要



|                           sentence                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Most deep learning methods require **substantial amounts of manually** labeled data, which **restricts** their applicability in may domains that suffer from **a dearth of** annotated resources. |
| Crafted adversarial data can easily fool the standard-trained deep models by adding **human-imperceptible** noise to the natural data, which leads to the security issue in applications such as medicine, finance, and autonomous driving. |
| Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective strategies for **promoting** model robustness, whereas even the state-of-the-art adversarially trained models struggle to exceed 60% robust test accuracy on CIFAR-10 without additional data, **which is far from practical**. |
| Detecting test samples **drawn** sufficiently **far away from** the training distribution statistically or adversarially is a **fundamental requirement** for **deploying** a good classifier **in** many real-world machine learning applications. |
| **Qualitative and quantitative** results are shown for both learning tasks, giving readers an insight on the importance of having AIM **in the context of** few-shot and continual learning. |
| We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate **that these networks**, **dubbed** sinusoidal representation networks or SIRENs, **are** ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. |
| making it fast to compute the partition function in the kernel space and to sample entries in a **divide and conquer** way. |
|                                                              |




### 引言



|                           sentence                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| There is a **lack of** **consensus** in the applied literature as to which variables to include in the propensity score model. |
| There is **no general agreement among** authors regarding where image processing stops and other related ares ... |
| There are **no clear-cut boundaries** in the continuum from image processing at one end to computer vision at the other. |
| Many existing defense baselines **struggle to remove** potential adversarial noises from input images, which **is different from** our proposed idea that **adaptively** predicts saliency maps for inputs with some new introduced generic noise to resist adversarial attacks. |
| There is **a long history of** pre-training general language representations, and we **briefly** review the most **widely-used** approaches in this section. |
| Batch Normalization (BN) is **a milestone technique** **in the development of** deep learning, **enabling** various networks to train. |
| In recent years, **an exploding growth in studies of** adversarial attacks and defenses has been witnessed. |
| This recent approach in object recognition ha made **enormous** progress in less than a decade. |
| Since [28], **numerous** works appeared to measure the saliency of pixels. |
| While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision **remain** limited. |
| **In response to** this difficulty, there has been **a recent surge in work** that tries to to reduce the complexity of generating an adversarial example, which **forms the bulk of** the additional computation in adversarial training |
| However, many deep neural networks are vulnerable to various **malicious** perturbations due to **their black-box nature**: a small (even **imperceptible**) perturbation of input data may lead to **completely wrong predictions** |
|       Modern consumers are **inundated** with choices.       |



|                           sentence                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   **The remainder of** the paper is organized as follows.    |
| In this paper we **revisit** the method for feed-forward stylization of Ulyanov et al. (2016) and show that a small change in a generator architecture leads to much improved results. |
| Our **high-level idea** is to measure the probability density of test sample on feature spaces of DNNs ... |
| Next the pairwise learning method Bayesian Personalized Ranking is shortly **recapitulated**. |



### 总结



|                           sentence                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Using error back-propagation method can be considered as **a double-edged sword** for deep neural networks. |
|                                                              |

| When full-network fine-tuning on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we use the augmentation popularized by Wide Residual Networks: 4 pixels are reflection padded on each side, and a 32 x 32 crop is randomly sampled from the padded image or its horizontal flip. |
| We found that the exact value of the hyperparameter $\alpha$ did not matter too much as long as it was roughly between 0.1 and 0.4. |
| We **start with** an initial ε value of 4/255 up to one-fourth  the training epochs, and **ramp up** this value linearly **to** a value of 16/255 at the last epoch. |
| For example, as shown in the **bottom** **panels** of Figure 1 |
| It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus **bridging** the performance **gap with** deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. |

| To compare different methods, we evaluate **the minimum, average, and maximum** l2 norm of the perturbation **over** all cases of wrong labels and report the average values **over** the test samples. |
| To avoid any **leakage of** the test set in generated samples |
| We **adopt early-stopping strategy** and **terminate** the training if the performance on validation set is not improved after 2 **consecutive** epochs. |
| The neural network **is implemented with** and **enjoys** **efficiency** from 1 × 1 convolutional layers. |
| As shown in Table I, Fβ -measure of DSS and DCL **drop** 30%–36% when **exposed to** the adversarial samples. |
| The adversarial attack **reduces** Fβ -measure of RFCN, Amulet, and UCF **by** 6%–12% while it only **lowers** Fβ of MC, LEGS, and MDF **by** 0.7%–1.1%. |
| Deep CNNs demonstrate a high fitting capacity **superior to** traditional methods using handcrafted features. |
| As Table II shows, DSS+ours **outperforms** DSS* **by** 71.9%–86.2% with respect to Fβ -measure on adversarial samples. |
| DSS+ours* still significantly **surpasses** DSS* **by** 71.86%–86.05% Fβ . |
| DSS+ours **exceeds** the second best DSS+TVM **by** 6.08% Fβ and 0.0337 MAE on the adversarial samples of HKU-IS dataset. |
| We find that as $\beta$ increases, there is an increase in robustness, which **plateaus** at around $\beta=0.3$. |
| Comparing GMF to BPR, we can see the performance of GMF with a sampling ratio of one is **on par with** BPR |
| One may note that self-distillation with fixed hyper-parameters is in fact **inferior in** terms of reducing robust overfitting, while its effectiveness can be significantly improved with the optimal hyper-parameters automatically determined by our method |
| To further **justify** the above fact, we plot output distributions of other layers |
| This **signifies** that it is increasingly difficult to find adversarial data that misclassifies the model. |
| **This is somewhat expected** since, on one hand, the robustness might not be affected much unless a sufficient number of filters (channels) are removed, which is different to depth that configures the entire residual block. |
| **This can be explained by** the gap between a pixel reconstruction task and a recognition task: the last several layers in an autoencoder are more specialized for reconstruction, but are less relevant for recognition. |
| Especially on Amazon Dataset with rich user behaviors, DIN **stands out** significantly. |
